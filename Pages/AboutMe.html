    Hi, I’m <strong>Abhishek Singh</strong>. I recently completed my B.Tech in Information Technology from <strong>KIET
      Group of Institutions</strong>
    with a
    CGPA of 7.4. I started my career as a Software Engineer Trainee at <strong>Digital Business People Private
      Limited</strong>, where
    I’m
    gaining hands-on experience in Customer Communication Management tools like Quadient Inspire, as well as improving
    my
    skills in JavaScript, React, and SQL. I’ve also done a 5-month internship in frontend development at
    <strong>Devsnest</strong> and
    worked
    on several projects using React, JavaScript, and backend tools. I’m passionate about building responsive and
    user-friendly interfaces and always eager to learn new technologies.
